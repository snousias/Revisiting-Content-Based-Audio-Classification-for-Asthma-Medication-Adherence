name: 'Revisiting Audio Analysis Algorithms for Asthma Medication Adherence: Evaluation
  with the RDA Benchmark Suite'
description: Asthma is a common, usually long-term respiratory disease with negative
  impact on society and the economy worldwide. Treatment involves using medical devices
  (inhalers) that distribute medicationto the airways, and its efficiency depends
  on the precision of the inhalation technique. Health monitoring systems equipped
  with sensors and embedded with sound signal detection enable the recognition of
  drug actuation and could be powerful tools for reliable audio content analysis.
  This paper revisits audio pattern recognition and machine learning techniques for
  asthma medication adherence assessment and presents the Respiratory and Drug Actuation
  (RDA)Suite for benchmarking and further research. The RDA Suite includes a set of
  tools for audio processing, feature extraction and classification and is provided
  along with a dataset consisting of respiratory and drug actuation sounds. The classification
  models in RDA areimplemented based on conventional and advanced machine learning
  and deep network architectures. This study provides a comparative evaluation of
  the implemented approaches, examines potential improvements and discusses challenges
  and future tendencies.
