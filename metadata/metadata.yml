name: Revisiting Content Based Audio Classification for Asthma Medication Adherence
description: Asthma is a common, usually long-term respiratory disease with negative
  impact on society and the economy worldwide. Treatment involves using medical devices
  (inhalers) that distribute medicationto the airways, and its efficiency depends
  on the precision of the inhalation technique. Health monitoring systems equipped
  with sensors and embedded with sound signal detection enable the recognition of
  drug actuation and could be powerful tools for reliable audio content analysis.
  This repository includes a set of tools for audio processing, feature extraction
  and classification and is provided along with a dataset consisting of respiratory
  and drug actuation sounds. The classification models are implemented based on machine
  learning and deep approaches.
